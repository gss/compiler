GSS compiler [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gss/compiler.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gss/compiler)
============

This library takes GSS rules as a string and outputs the parsed AST as JSON. The JSON can then be executed by the [GSS engine](https://github.com/gss/engine) to change formatting of a web page.
